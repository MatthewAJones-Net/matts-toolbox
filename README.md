# Matt’s Toolbox

A small collection of practical scripts, checks and templates I use for day-to-day network and infrastructure work.

## Inside this repo you’ll find:
- PowerShell, Shell and Batch scripts 
- Runbooks and configs for common network/infrastructure ops
- Templates and snippets you might find handy
- Safety checks to avoid common mistakes

## Sanitisation / safety notes
To avoid exposing customer or employer information:
- No customer names, domains, IP ranges, ticket references or screenshots
- No credentials, API keys, tokens or certificates
- Any values that could identify a real environment have been removed or replaced
